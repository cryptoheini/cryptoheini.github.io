# Introduction
Getting into crypto wild west is full of traps. Companies and more experienced people will try to catch you early and squeeze money out of you. I did some mistakes while learning and also friends showed the need of this list. Consider it as your drivers license for cryptos. For sure it will grow over time :)

## Handling cryptos
This is a crucial point for me. Learn how to handle cryptos! It will help you alot while learning. **If you do a new step for first time make sure you test it with a small amount.**

### What you know
When you were young you (hopefully) learned how to deal with money. You got a bank account and maybe as a birthday present someone sent some money to this bank account. If you want to buy something in a shop you go to the ATM to get some cash. Then you pick a item at a shop and go to the cashier. If you don't have the exact amount of the items' price you give a larger note and get the return.

### What you don't know
The crypto world is not so different to what you already know. You are able to open accounts quite easy (this is your address) and you can access it via a secret ("private key"). With your secret you can send around money between exchanges and some shops will make paymants via crypto available to purchase items.

# Trading
- I suggest to not trade crypto currencies. This is hard and most likely you will loose some money doing it. The profits from advanced traders will come from beginners like you :)
- Every trade could be a taxable event. Please make sure you document every trade (losses/profits) and know what kind of taxes you need to pay for it.

# Wallets
- never create seeds (your private key) with an online service 

# Exchanges
- never use platforms where you can only buy in with USD/EURO/... and buy crypto currencies but don't allow you to transfer to other platforms (so you will first need to sell again to USD/EURO/... and then deposit to the new service). An example for this it the etoro platform. They catched many of my friends.
- If you want to get a special coin check the withdraw fees for that coins on different exchanges. Some exchanges have ridiculous fees on withdraw.
- you do not own the coins because you do not own the private keys
- bever leave big amounts of coins laying around on exchanges
