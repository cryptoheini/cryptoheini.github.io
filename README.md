# Introduction
Getting into crypto wild west is full of traps. I did some mistakes while learning and also friends showed the need of this list. This page will grow over time :)

# Trading
- I suggest to not trade crypto currencies. This is hard and most likely you will loose some money doing it. The profits from pros will come from beginners :)

# Wallets
- never create seeds (your private key) with an online service 

# Exchanges
- never use platforms where you can only buy in with USD/EURO/... and buy crypto currencies but don't allow you to transfer to other platforms (so you will first need to sell again to USD/EURO/... and then deposit to the new service). An example for this it the etoro platform. They catched many of my friends.
- you do not own the coins because you do not own the private keys
- bever leave big amounts of coins laying around on exchanges
