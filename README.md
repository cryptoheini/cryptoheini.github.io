# Introduction
Getting into crypto wild west is full of traps. I did some mistakes while learning and also friends showed the need of this list. This page will grow over time :)

# Wallets
- never create seeds (your private key) with an online service 

# Exchanges
- you do not own the coins because you do not own the private keys
- bever leave big amounts of coins laying around on exchanges

# Donations
