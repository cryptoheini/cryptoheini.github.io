# Introduction
Getting into crypto wild west is full of traps. Companies and more experienced people will try to catch you early and squeeze money out of you.

I did some mistakes while learning and also friends showed the need of this list. **Consider it as your drivers licence for cryptos**. For sure it will grow over time as I still make mistakes along the path :)

# Valuation
- Many beginners think that a coin with a low price can reach the price of bitcoin and see big profits coming. You need to learn that **a coin is valued by the total number of created coins multiplied by the current price (this is the marketcap)**. The marketcap results in the different ranking. For example Ripple has a much larger supply than Bitcoin and therefore is traded at a much lower price.
- If you visit a site like [coinmarketcap.com](https://www.coinmarketcap.com) or [worldcoinindex.com](https://www.worldcoinindex.com) the price is shown differently. The reason behind this is that at different exchanges the price is different for a coin. Different listing pages include different exchanges and have a different update frequency. They calculate the average and the result is a different price.

# Handling cryptos
This is a crucial point for me. Learn how to handle cryptos! 

- **If you try a new step for first time make sure you test it with a small amount.**
- Send some coins from one exchange to another exchange. Make sure you do not pay large fees (use a coin which is supported by many exchanges, Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are a good bet at the moment.
- Install a desktop wallet for your coin. **Learn how to backup the private key before sending coins to it.**
- Recover your wallet from the saved private key. E.g. install the wallet on a different computer and enter the private key there!
- Send some coins from an exchange to your wallet.

# Trading
- For beginners I suggest to not trade crypto currencies. This is hard and most likely you will loose some money doing it. The profits from advanced traders will come from beginners like you :)
- Every trade could be a taxable event. Please make sure you document every trade (losses/profits) and know what kind of taxes you need to pay for it.

# Wallets
- never create seeds (your private key) with an online service 

# Exchanges
- never use platforms where you can only buy in with USD/EURO/... and buy crypto currencies but don't allow you to transfer to other platforms (so you will first need to sell again to USD/EURO/... and then deposit to the new service). An example for this it the etoro platform. They catched many of my friends.
- If you want to get a special coin check the withdraw fees for that coins on different exchanges. Some exchanges have ridiculous fees on withdraw.
- you do not own the coins because you do not own the private keys
- bever leave big amounts of coins laying around on exchanges
